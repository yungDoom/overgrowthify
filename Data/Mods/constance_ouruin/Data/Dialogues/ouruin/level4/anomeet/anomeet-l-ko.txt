say 2 "High Chancellor Ano" "Edsel came with us willingly. [wait 0.2]He knew what had to be done... [wait 0.2]He understood what was at stake."
say 1 "Amos" "So your first words to me are lies. [wait 0.2]I expected nothing less."
say 2 "High Chancellor Ano" "I know it's not easy to believe. [wait 0.2]But you will, [wait 0.1]in time."
say 1 "Amos" "Drop the act and leave us alone!"
say 2 "High Chancellor Ano" "If I truly left you alone, [wait 0.1]you would've frozen to death, [wait 0.1]starved, [wait 0.1]or bled out in a gutter. [wait 0.2]Your life's been hard..."

say 1 "Amos" "You ruined our lives."
say 2 "High Chancellor Ano" "Then let me make it up to you."
